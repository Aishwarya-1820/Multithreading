    "    A thread is a unit of execution within a process. Multithreading refers to concurrently executing multiple threads by rapidly switching the control of the CPU between threads (called context switching). The Python Global Interpreter Lock limits one thread to run at a time even if the machine contains multiple processors.\n",
    "    Python multithreading enables efficient utilization of the resources as the threads share the data space and memory. Multithreading in Python allows the concurrent and parallel occurrence of various tasks. It causes a reduction in time consumption or response time, thereby increasing the performance.\n",
